### What is this?
This is another repo exploring the virtual dom and diffing.  I am having a lot of trouble moving past just having a virtual dom and diffing and into managing state.  I would like completely contained components, and would not like state just floating off somewhere else in space via a random variable.  Im investigating a class based approach and an approach similar to hooks.
